Restless in the sun-baked landscapes of New Mexico, my childhood home, I got the travel bug young from meeting great folks via my open source contributions. This quickly escalated to full-time contracting and wandering to eventually landing me where I am today, running a software development consultancy from the Austrian Alps.

During the late '00s I was walked, pedaled and paddled my around three continents, studied Arabic, studied Quechua and crossed from the North Sea to the Black Sea along the great European rivers with a bike and a packraft.
I was lucky to find clients that would put up with my offline-for-weeks at a time way of life.

But as these stories often go, my eastward trajectory was permanently altered when I met my future partner during those travels.
What was supposed to be a brief winter stop in Albania became putting down roots in Austria&mdash;an unexpected transition from vagabond to immigrant to resident.

Trading the travel visa for a residency visa put a tempoary end to my freelancing career. Details aside[^note1], to get a work visa as a sole-proprietor in Austria you need to invest six figures. But my business involved an internet connection, a computer, and a keyboard. An expensive mechanical keyboard yes, but not enough to get me a Selbständige Schlüsselkräfte visa.

[^note1]: Some people find it boring, others fascinating. Ask me if you want.

So I had to go to work for someone else. I worked in an office *full-time* for the first time in my life with the amazing team at [![Cropster's logo](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACAAAAAgCAYAAABzenr0AAAAyElEQVR4AWJwL/AZUDz4HdBw2MkOG8YwaImvExBHEIOdNnnIANqvYxsAQSAKw/swkRW1aziAgzAMnSZ2FA5yYnd5MQoe8RVS/K33gckZEYBDXS7m5DIFOB+WHyo14Q3gcA/DsAgnl8p2BOB1y0MTXLtUttwBUgFgVIDhBWBFgH7vwgR4NmDsgL8AFjZgJgBgCzYG7AVtcHI7wBAHoL+eVoCvGIirPuSiFWCtAzogsAGeCUhqOAXgmABXuopTw8LT5sQd3X9OP+8AiEMaS3dX2QMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=) Cropster](https://cropster.com). It was a great experience and an important cultural integration step, but it also solidified my desire to become self-employed. The benefits of being an employee were outweighed by the freedom and control that self-employment brings.

A few years later, my partner and I wanted to start a family and I obtained a permanent Austrian residency visa. The time was right, it was time to return to self-employment. I (re) established [![](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACAAAAAgCAYAAABzenr0AAAACXBIWXMAAAKAAAACgAFbTV9wAAAAGXRFWHRTb2Z0d2FyZQB3d3cuaW5rc2NhcGUub3Jnm+48GgAABGVJREFUWIXVl19Im1cYxp9EM5O4NFtC0vxRUEFm1VYXkKQLozSa0lYcBMGBCGXsYhe5cDc6d7NK8MrLQi9yI6NSKNGLSLtcFFGYqWXBdrOCRN1AR9RlVSR/XJPP5Ht20S2baGz8pIy98F2c9z3fc37n5Zz35YASLRuNMP7lR8wuz0uVIEnKIdFkFSqUvW+CTPmuVInXOiR5JoUzmuQM7O3tIZlMIrs4i5dfX8OruUlI2cupAO7evQu1Wg2ZTAadTge73Y7c1s/I//4rhF9+gsfjwf37909HUOphyWQyVCqVfPHixSG/eCAws/Q9xT9SDIfD1Ov1b+cQlpWVQS6XIx6PQxCEv+hFQMyjovljQFmJWCwGhULxdjJAkuPj49RoNLx37x7FA4Evv/mE259fYPo7Pzc3N6lQKBgKhd5OBgCgr68PTqfzNXh6D7nYCkAR2aU5AIBWq8WNGzdOlQDJt0D+nhGV1z6DoqYZlZ1fSJVBueQ/AWg+/eqfwdaWJA3JGTjOZDLZfwsgxf4/ANlsFj6fD+FwGFqt9qiQXI5EIgGfz4dsNls6QSl3dX19nc3Nzbx+/TqXlpZIkqFQiK2trbTZbJyeniZJLiws0O1289KlS9zY2CipDrwRYHNzk9XV1RweHqYoigW/2+0mAAJgV1dXwS+KIgcGBmixWLi6uno2gFwuR6fTyaGhoSMxl8tVALh58+aRuNfr5eXLlw9BnxpgcnKSLS0tzOVyJElBEPjs2bOSAARBYE1NzRtL84kAdrudgUCgMH706BEBcG1t7ViAkZER9vf3c39/nyTp9/vZ3t4uDSAWi1GlUhXESHJqaooAGI1GjwVQKBQEUGjZOzs7LC8vZyKRKApQtBTHYjE0NjZCrVYXfEajEZWVlWhoaCjphun1etTV1WF5eRkOh+PYOUXrQDKZhMFgOORzOBxIp9MgCZfLVXRhHmTxaj6I/N5vsFqtSCaTRecWzUBFRQXi8TgWFxfR1NSE8vLS+1b2x2kk5r+F0ubG/v4+lEpl0blFM2A2m7GysoJQKIQrV65gcHAQW0U6XiQSgdvtRi6XAwAoalvwzgdtUHzYgWg0itra2tMD1NfXw2AwwOl0Ym5uDhcvXsTVq1dx69YtRCKRQ3P1ej2sVis8Hg9u376NC04XdIPj+CGjgdlsRnV1dVGAE98Fo6OjWFhYQCAQAAAIgoCxsTFsb28jHA5jZmYGAODxeGC1WlFVVYXd3V1otVpYLBZMTEygs7MTXq+3KMCJdSCVStFsNvPhw4dHYv++ht3d3UfiY2NjPH/+PNPp9ElLvLkXPHnyhEajkU+fPi0ZYHZ2lufOnSs0qTMBkGQwGKTBYKDf72c+n2cmk2F7eztNJhMtFgt7enqYSCSYz+d5584d6nQ6BoPBUqRLAyDJ58+fs62tjVarlSqVqrD7vz+5XE6TyUSHw3Hk8XKSnepxKooiHj9+jAcPHmB+fh6pVApqtRoajQY2mw29vb3o6OgoVQ4A8CcmR2A1E8N4mAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==) Outskirts Labs](https://outskirtslabs.com) as an Austrian sole-proprietor.


Having developed a network of contacts in the Human Rights and Internet Freedom space, I opened Outskirts Labs as a software design
and development consultancy focusing on those clients *at the edge.* The edge of what? The edge of technical capacity, sustainable funding, and mainstream attention ([read more](#)).

These days, I run Outskirts Labs from my home office in Innsbruck, Austria.
Between client calls and coding sessions, I'm navigating the even more challenging terrain of fatherhood
to two tiny humans [^note2] who constantly remind me
that my most meaningful work happens in the space carved out beyond professional identities and tech solutions.

[^note2]: Yes, and a dog. I'm not so worried about his privacy, so he gets a picture. His name is Benji.

They've taught me that while code may crash and recover, there's no automatic rollback for missing the bedtime story.
