I grew up restless in New Mexico, where sun-baked landscapes made me dream of distant places.
Those dreams found their outlet through open source, where I connected with an international community of developers.
This quickly escalated to full-time contracting and wandering, eventually landing me where I am today: running a software development consultancy from the Austrian Alps

During the late '00s, I wandered three continents by foot, bike, and boat.
I studied Arabic and Quechua, and crossed Europe from the North Sea to the Black Sea along its great rivers with a bike and packraft
I was lucky to find clients who tolerated my offline-for-weeks-at-a-time lifestyle.

But as these stories often go, my eastward trajectory was permanently altered when I met my future partner along the way
A brief winter stop in Albania led to putting down roots in Austria&mdash;an unexpected transition from vagabond to immigrant to resident

Trading my travel visa for a residency visa put a temporary end to my freelancing career
To get a work visa as a sole proprietor in Austria, you need to make a substantial investment in Austria[^note1].
My business required only an internet connection, a computer, and a keyboard.
And while my mechanical keyboard was expensive enough to feel like an investment, Austria's visa authorities were thinking more along the lines of real estate, oh, and six to seven figures minimum.

[^note1]: Very interesting topic! Some people find it boring, others fascinating. Ask me if you want.

So I went to work for someone else.
For the first time in my life, I worked full-time in an office, joining the amazing team at [![Cropster's logo](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACAAAAAgCAYAAABzenr0AAAAyElEQVR4AWJwL/AZUDz4HdBw2MkOG8YwaImvExBHEIOdNnnIANqvYxsAQSAKw/swkRW1aziAgzAMnSZ2FA5yYnd5MQoe8RVS/K33gckZEYBDXS7m5DIFOB+WHyo14Q3gcA/DsAgnl8p2BOB1y0MTXLtUttwBUgFgVIDhBWBFgH7vwgR4NmDsgL8AFjZgJgBgCzYG7AVtcHI7wBAHoL+eVoCvGIirPuSiFWCtAzogsAGeCUhqOAXgmABXuopTw8LT5sQd3X9OP+8AiEMaS3dX2QMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=) Cropster](https://cropster.com).
While I valued the mentorship and cultural immersion, the daily office rhythm only solidified my desire to become self-employed.
The benefits of being an employee were outweighed by the freedom and control that self-employment brings.
That's a bigger deal than it might sound, Austrian employees have it pretty great with generous vacation time, strong labor protections, and benefits that would make most American workers weep.

A few years later, my partner and I decided to start a family, and I was able to obtain permanent Austrian residency
The timing was finally right to return to self-employment.

Having developed a network in the human rights and internet freedom space, I opened Outskirts Labs as a software consultancy serving clients *at the edge*.
The edge of what? The edge of technical capacity, sustainable funding, and mainstream attention.

These days, I run Outskirts Labs from my home office in Innsbruck, Austria.

Between client calls and coding sessions, I'm learning to navigate fatherhood with two tiny humans[^note2].
They remind me daily that my most important work has nothing to do with code or consultancy.

[^note2]: Yes, and a dog. I'm not so worried about his privacy, so he gets a picture. His name is Benji.
